# My favorite music

Unusual

They say strange fascination, infatuation

A lunatic

Call me what suits your taste, I just wanna taste

And I've always heard it's what's inside that counts

'Cause my insides are red

And yours are too

And the red on my face

Is matching you
And goodness you're bleeding

What a wonderful feeling

You're down and you're pleading

My head is just reeling

The red means I love you

Tasting your blood means I love you

The red means I love you

The red means I love you
